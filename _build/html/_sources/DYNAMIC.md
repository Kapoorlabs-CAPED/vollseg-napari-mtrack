# Dynamic Instability Definition

## Calculating Growth and Shrink Rates:

- The growth rate and shrink rate are calculated based on the slope of the kymograph corresponding to the growing and shrinking phases, respectively.
- The rates are computed for each event and added to the appropriate event list (growth or shrink).

## Catastrophe and Rescue Frequencies:

- Catastrophe and rescue frequencies are calculated based on event counts.
- Catastrophe frequency is incremented when a microtubule undergoes a catastrophe event.
- Rescue frequency is incremented when a microtubule undergoes a rescue event.
- Both frequencies are normalized by dividing by the total time of observation and microscope calibration time.
