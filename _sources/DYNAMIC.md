# Dynamic instability definition

## Growth Rate (µm/s):

The growth rate represents the speed at which the microtubule plus end is advancing during the growth phase.
Calculate the slope of the linear portion of the kymograph corresponding to the growing phase. You can use the formula: Growth Rate = ΔDistance / ΔTime, where ΔDistance is the change in position and ΔTime is the change in time.

## Shrink Rate (µm/s):

The shrink rate is the speed at which the microtubule plus end is shortening during the shrinking phase.
Calculate the slope of the linear portion of the kymograph corresponding to the shrinking phase. You can use the formula: Shrink Rate = ΔDistance / ΔTime, where ΔDistance is the change in position and ΔTime is the change in time.

## Catastrophe Frequency (events per unit time):

Catastrophe frequency measures how often microtubules transition from the growth phase to the shrinking phase.
Count the number of catastrophe events in a given time interval and divide by the length of that time interval. Formula: Catastrophe Frequency = Number of Catastrophes / Time Interval.

## Rescue Frequency (events per unit time):

Rescue frequency quantifies how often microtubules transition from the shrinking phase to the growth phase.
Count the number of rescue events in a given time interval and divide by the length of that time interval. Formula: Rescue Frequency = Number of Rescues / Time Interval.
